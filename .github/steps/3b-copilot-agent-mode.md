### :keyboard: Bonus Activity - Preview of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

Nice! You found this hidden bonus level! 🎮 👾

If you have been keeping an eye on Github, you may have heard about **Agent** mode.
It's a public preview feature for GitHub Copilot.

But... it's only for _Insiders_! 😎🤫

But... good news. Anyone can access the Insiders version if they know the tricks. Yay! 🧐🎉
